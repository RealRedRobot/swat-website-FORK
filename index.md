# Team 1806 S.W.A.T. Website

## FAQs

### What are the github pages for?
These pages are here to share information, best practices, tips and tricks, and resources to the Team 1806 website developers.

### I'm new... where should I start?
I would start of course with the "Getting Started" page to see what tools were used to make the site, what languages we use, how to get started making changes, and how to upload these changes.

### What if I already know about *insert item here*. Does it matter?
Awesome! If you already know about our tech stack (React, Firebase, and Git/GitHub), take a look at the "File Structure" page to make sure you know how our site is laid out. Then check out the "Contributing" and "Best Practices" pages to learn more about how to make changes to the site and the processes we use to update the live site?

### Who should I contact if I have questions?
Your mentor should be the number one resource, use them. If there is a more specific question that the mentor does not know, contact Christian Sheridan christian.sheridan02@gmail.com, make sure to mention you are from team 1806 and are working on the website.
